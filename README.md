# Linked Connections Server

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/linkedconnections/linked-connections-server/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/linkedconnections/linked-connections-server?branch=master)

Express based Web Server that exposes [Linked Connections](http://linkedconnections.org/) data fragments using [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) serialization format. It also provides a built-in tool to parse [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/tansit/gtfs/reference/) and [GTFS Realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) transport dataset feeds into a Linked Connections Directed Acyclic Graph using [GTFS2LC](https://github.com/linkedconnections/gtfs2lc) and fragment it following a configurable predefined size.

## Installation

First make sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 11.7.x or superior installed. To install the server proceed as follows:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/julianrojas87/linked-connections-server.git
cd linked-connections-server
npm install
```

## Configuration

The configuration is made through two different config files. One is for defining Web Server parameters ([server_config.json](https://github.com/julianrojas87/linked-connections-server/blob/master/server_config.json.example)) and the other is for defining the different data sources that will be managed and exposed through the Linked Connections Server ([datasets_config.json](https://github.com/julianrojas87/linked-connections-server/blob/master/datasets_config.json.example)). Next you could find an example and a description of each config file.

### Web Server configuration

As mentioned above the Web server configuration is made using the ([server_config.json](https://github.com/julianrojas87/linked-connections-server/blob/master/server_config.json.example)) config file which uses the JSON format and defines the following properties:

- **hostname:** Used to define the Web Server host name. **Is a mandatory parameter**.

- **port:** TCP/IP port to be used by the Web Server to receive requests. **Is a mandatory parameter**.

- **protocol:** Used to define the accepted protocol by the Web Server which could be either HTTP o HTTPS. In case that both protocols are supported there is no need to define this parameter, but all requests made to the server **MUST** contain the **X-Forwarded-Proto** header stating the procotol being used. This is useful when the server is used along with cache management servers.

- **logLevel:** Used to define the logging level of the server. We use the [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels) library to manage logs. If not specified, the default level is `info`.

This is a configuration example:

```js
{
    "hostname": "localhost:3000",
    "port": 3000,
    "protocol": "http" // or https
    "logLevel": "info" //error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly
}
```

### Datasets configuration

The Web Server does not provide any functionality by itself, it needs at least one dataset (in GTFS format) that can be downloaded to be processed and exposed as Linked Connections. To tell the server where to find and store such datasets, we use the ([datasets_config.json](https://github.com/julianrojas87/linked-connections-server/blob/master/datasets_config.json.example)) config file. All the parameters in this config file are **Mandatory**, otherwise the server won't function properly. This file contains the following parameters:

- **storage:** This is the path that tells the server where to store and where to look for the data fragments, created from the different datasets. **This should not include a trailing slash**. Make sure you have enough disk space to store and process datasets.

- **sortMemory:** Max amount of RAM memory that can be used by the Linked Connections sorting process. Default is 2G.  

- **organization:** URI and name of the data publisher.

- **keywords:** Related keywords for a given dataset. E.g., types of vehicles available.

- **companyName:** Name of the transport company that provides the GTFS dataset feed.

- **geographicArea:** [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) URI that represents the geographic area served by the public transport provider.

- **downloadUrl:** URL where the GTFS dataset feed can be downloaded.

- **downloadOnLaunch:** Boolean parameter that indicates if the GTFS feed is to be downloaded and processed upon server launch.

- **updatePeriod:** Cron expression that defines how often should the server look for and process a new version of the dataset. We use the [node-cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) library for this.

- **fragmentSize:** Defines the maximum size of every linked data fragment in bytes.

- **realTimeData:** If available, here we define all the parameters related with a GTFS-RT feed.
    - **downloadUrl:** Here we define the URL to download the GTFS-RT data feed.
    - **headers**: Some GTFS-RT feeds require API keys to be accessed.
    - **updatePeriod:** Cron expression that defines how often should the server look for and process a new version of the dataset. We use the [node-cron](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-cron) library for this.
    - **fragmentTimeSpan:** This defines the fragmentation of real-time data. It represents the time span of every fragment in seconds.
    - **compressionPeriod:** Cron expression that defines how often will the real-time data be compressed using gzip in order to reduce storage consumption.
    - **indexStore:** Indicates where the required static indexes (routes, trips, stops and stop_times) will be stored while processing GTFS-RT updates. `MemStore` for RAM and `KeyvStore` for disk.
    - **deduce**: If the GTFS-RT feed does not provide a explicit `tripId` for every update, set this parameter to `true`, so they can be identified using additional GTFS indexes.

- **baseURIs:** Here we define the URI templates that will be used to create the unique identifiers of each of the entities found in the Linked Connections. Is necessary to define URIs for [Connections](http://semweb.datasciencelab.be/ns/linkedconnections#Connection), [Stops](https://github.com/OpenTransport/linked-gtfs/blob/master/spec.md), [Trips](https://github.com/OpenTransport/linked-gtfs/blob/master/spec.md) and [Routes](https://github.com/OpenTransport/linked-gtfs/blob/master/spec.md). This is the only optional parameter and in case that is not defined, all base URIs will have a <http://example.org/> pattern, but we recommend to always use dereferenceable URIs. Follow the [RFC 6570](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) specification to define your URIs using the column names of the `routes` and `trips` GTFS source files. See an example next.

```js
{
    "storage": "/opt/linked-connections-data", //datasets storage path
    "organization": {
        "id": "https://...",
        "name": "Organization name"
    },
    "datasets":[
        {
            "companyName": "companyX",
            "keywords": ["Keyword1", "Keyword2"],
            "geographicArea": "http://sws.geonames.org/...", // Geo names URI
            "downloadUrl": "https://...",
            "downloadOnLaunch": false,
            "updatePeriod": "0 0 3 * * *", //every day at 3 am
            "fragmentSize": 50000, // 50 Kb

                "headers": { "apiKeyHttpHeader": "my_api_key" },
                "updatePeriod": "*/30 * * * * *", //every 30s

                "deduce": true // Set true only if the GTFS-RT feed does not provide tripIds
            },
            "baseURIs": {
                "stop": "http://example.org/stops/{stop_id}",
                "route": "http://example.org/routes/{routes.route_id}",
                "trip": "http://example.org/trips/{routes.route_id}/{trips.startTime(yyyyMMdd)}",
                "connection:" 'http://example.org/connections/{routes.route_id}/{trips.startTime(yyyyMMdd)}{connection.departureStop}'
            }
        },
        {
            "companyName": "companyY",
            "keywords": ["Keyword1", "Keyword2"],
            "geographicArea": "http://sws.geonames.org/...", // Geo names URI
            "downloadUrl": "http://...",
            "downloadOnLaunch": false,
            "updatePeriod": "0 0 3 * * *", //every day at 3am
            "baseURIs": {
                "stop": "http://example.org/stops/{stop_id}",
                "route": "http://example.org/routes/{routes.route_id}",
                "trip": "http://example.org/trips/{routes.route_id}/{trips.startTime(yyyyMMdd)}",
                "connection:" 'http://example.org/connections/{routes.route_id}/{trips.startTime(yyyyMMdd)}{connection.departureStop}'
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that for defining the URI templates you can use the entity `connection` which consists of a `departureStop`, `departureTime`, `arrivalStop` and an `arrivalTime`. We have also noticed that using the start time of a trip (`trip.startTime`) is also a good practice to uniquely identify trips or even connections. If using any of the times variables you can define a specific format (see [here](https://date-fns.org/v2.9.0/docs/format)) as shown in the previous example.

## Run it

Once you have properly configured the server you can run the data fetching and the Web server separately:

```bash
cd linked-connections-server
node bin/datasets # Data fetching
node bin/web-server # Linked Connections Web server
```

## Use it

To use it make sure you already have at least one fully processed dataset (the logs will tell you when). If so you can query the Linked Connections using the departure time as a parameter like this for example:

```http
http://localhost:3000/companyX/connections?departureTime=2017-08-11T16:45:00.000Z
```

If available, the server will redirect you to the Linked Connections fragment that contains connections with departure times as close as possible to the one requested.

The server also publishes the stops and routes of every defined GTFS datasource:

```http
http://localhost:3000/companyX/stops
http://localhost:3000/companyX/routes
```

A [DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) catalog describing all datasets of a certain company can be obtained like this:

```http
http://localhost:3000/companyX/catalog
```

## Historic Data

The server also allows querying historic data by means of the [Memento Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089) which enables time-based content negotiation over HTTP. By using the **Accept-Datetime** header a client can request the state of a resource at a given moment. If existing, the server will respond with a 302 Found containing the URI of the stored version of such resource. For example:

```bash
curl -v -L -H "Accept-Datetime: 2017-10-06T13:00:00.000Z" http://localhost:3000/companyX/connections?departureTime=2017-10-06T15:50:00.000Z

> GET /companyX/connections?departureTime=2017-10-06T15:50:00.000Z HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3000
> User-Agent: curl/7.52.1
> Accept: */*
> Accept-Datetime: 2017-10-06T13:00:00.000Z

< HTTP/1.1 302 Found

> Host: localhost:3000
> User-Agent: curl/7.52.1

```

The previous example shows a request made to obtain the Connections fragment identified by the URL <http://localhost:3000/companyX/connections?departureTime=2017-10-06T15:50:00.000Z,> but specifically the state of this fragment as it was at **Accept-Datetime: 2017-10-06T13:00:00.000Z**. This means that is possible to know what was the state of the delays at 13:00 for the departures at 15:50 on 2017-10-06.
